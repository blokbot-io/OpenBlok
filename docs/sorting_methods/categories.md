# General Definitions

[Lego Unit (LU)](https://www.designreview.byu.edu/collections/the-lego-brick) - The dimensional relation of units that are used to design Lego parts. A stud is has a LU of 1 and a diameter of 2 LU. A standard plate or tile is 2 LU and a brick is at least 6 LU high or the equivalent of 3 stacked plates.

Top - For parts with studs, the face with the stud is to be considered the top.

## Top Level (Category)

**Uncategorized** - Parts that are not categorized.

**Brick** | Three plates or more thick, rectangular in shape, with at least one stud on top.

**Plate** | A third the thickness of a brick, with at least one stud on top.

**Slope** | consists of one or more inclined planes without a stud on top.

**Tile** | The same thickness as a plate without studs on top.

**Decorative** | A decorative part that is not a brick, plate, or tile.

**Nature** | A part with organic structure intended to be recognizable as a naturally occurring object.

## Second Level (Sub Category)

**Brick, Modified** | A section of the part can be classified as a brick, but the part is modified. The modifications are extensions of the original brick section.

**Brick, Slope** | A section of the part can be classified as a brick, but it contains a modification that removes a section of the standard brick resulting in a slope. The slop cuts off the top of the brick where a stud would typically be. The slop is a flat chamfer or bevel cut.

**Brick, Inverted Slope** | A section of the part can be classified as a brick, but it contains a modification that removes a section of the standard brick resulting in an inverted slope. The slop cuts off the bottom of the brick starting from the top edge going inward. The slop is a flat chamfer or bevel cut.

**Plate, Modified** | A section of the part can be classified as a plate, but the part is modified. The modifications are extensions of the original plate section.
